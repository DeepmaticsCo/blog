There are >1500 papers in arXiv about prompt engineering. Every new model that comes out or if someone finds a better way to write a prompt and achieve better results, it is given a name and called a certain way of prompting. This has led to various techniques such as few-shot learning, chain of trees, self-critisicm, plannign strategies and all sorts of other names that are difficult to keep track of and end up being counter productive. 

Lost in the world of prompting, is when I came across this paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.06608" target="_blank">The Prompt Report: A Systematic Survey of Prompt Engineering Techniques</a>
